            Community Compass is dedicated to helping migrant workers in Maharashtra easily access the schemes and services available to them. Our goal is to break down the barriers that prevent workers from accessing vital benefits such as pensions, housing, employment opportunities, and healthcare.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            We strive to create a user-friendly platform that not only informs but also empowers the migrant worker community by ensuring that they can easily find and apply for various welfare schemes.
